The Verification Utility for Locating, Containing, And Notifying (VULCAN) Fire Response Operations system is designed to enhance fire prevention, monitoring, and response operations (especially rural regions) through the use of machine learning powered fire detection, response management, and alert systems.  

Using NASA LANDSAT real-time data, the VULCAN utility can display detected fires in the user-defined surveying region. Fires are classified as suspected, verified, or responding by the system, which monitors and updates the observed state through the lifecycle of the fire. Across the span of the NASA Space Apps challenge, the VULCAN team developed a machine learning model, trained on sources including, but not limited to NOAA satellite data. The product, in conjunction with the Fosberg Fire Weather Index, reports the certainty with which a LANDSAT detected fire has been accurately reported. 

Based on the conditions of this report, the automated system grants an operator the ability to send cellular alerts over SMS to residents within the surveyed region. The strategy is highly advantageous, as:
1. The low-data overhead is suited to areas with limited connectivity
2. Native compatibility with cellular devices, coupled with ease-of-use, speed community adoption
3. Semi-automated messaging systems involve comparatively less maintenance and operational cost
   
To send a community notification, the system alerts an operator to confirm dissemination, reducing the possibility of false fire notifications. The interface allows an operator to easily manage contact endpoints, such as phone numbers, to prevent the user interface from ever becoming a limiting factor in fire response.

As the utility is intended for operation in limited conditions by persons of local authority, the software has been designed to run in the background to reduce operational cost and active involvement by personnel. Featuring a color-coded annotated map of the region, the operator can easily identify new fires and alert necessary personnel in a timely manner.
	
Aperations are supported through real-time cloud storage which, in addition to minimal internet usage, features local storage capabilities. The databases, accessed both locally and through the cloud, scale to support a high volume of operable systems, with data filtered prior to uploading/saving to minimize storage use.

Through innovative applications of machine learning and analytical automation, the VULCAN Fire Response Operations utility is economically viable, requires little maintenance, is optimized for limited network conditions, operates intuitively, and enables rural regions to manage local emergencies before they become hazardous to the public. VULCAN Fire Response Operations hold the potential to grow into a crucial role in a safer future, preserving air quality and protecting the environment.
